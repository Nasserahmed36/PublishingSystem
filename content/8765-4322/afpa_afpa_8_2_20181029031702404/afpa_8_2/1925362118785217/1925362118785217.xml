      diagnosis of likely cause of death prior to autopsy are 1) the heart, and 2) the brain,
      because of their frequent involvement in the pathophysiology of sudden deaths. Perhaps the
      lungs also, with their pulmonary thromboemboli, would be near the top of the list. The liver
      and pancreas, however, are the focus of this issue, and the hepatobiliary system is one rich
      in potential pathology, including lethal and other forensically-relevant pathology.
      Overlooking this organ system in any autopsy would be a grave error, and it is only fitting
      that it be the featured theme for an issue of <italic>Academic Forensic
      Pathology</italic>.</p><p>The particular pathologic entities in the hepatobiliary system most relevant to forensic
      pathology tend to be those related to trauma, including child abuse; hepatic necrosis;
      alcohol-related pathologies of the liver like cirrhosis, alcoholic hepatitis, and fatty liver;
      nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and metabolic syndrome/diabetes mellitus; and acute and
      chronic pancreatitis (whether related to alcohol or other disease processes). Four invited
      reviews in this issue address the pancreas. Dr. Alfredo Walker’s exhaustive review of the
      adult pancreas in disease and trauma describes the myriad of pancreatic conditions that may be
      encountered during a forensic autopsy, along with history, pathophysiology, diagnostic
      features, and significance. Forensic pathologists will find the description and history of the
      finding of vacuolation of pancreatic acinar cells particularly interesting. Dr. Robert
      Stoppacher reviews acute pancreatitis and its relationship to sudden death addresses the
      diagnosis of acute pancreatitis, including hemorrhagic pancreatitis, and its differentiation
      from postmortem autolysis type changes, with diagnostic gross and histologic images. Dr.
      Katherine Callahan and I provide a critical evaluation of pancreatic injuries in children and
      an evidence-based look at which injuries are most specific for child abuse, with an
      illustrative case presentation. Finally, Dr. Theodore Brown and coauthor Dr. Joseph Prahlow
      discuss the utility of postmortem serum amylase and lipase testing in the diagnosis of
      pancreatitis.</p><p>Three articles focus on the liver, and injury and disease states highly relevant to forensic
      pathologists. Dr. Christopher Milroy reviews fatty liver disease, and tackles the question of
      whether “fatty liver” is a competent cause of death or has a direct role in sudden death.
      (Spoiler alert: Yes, fatty liver has been associated with sudden death; however, one should
      look closer for the exact mechanism and other related causes). Dr. Christopher Rogers presents
      a look at patterns of liver trauma, with a focus on appropriate documentation of injuries at
      autopsy in sufficient detail to provide the information needed by trauma surgery teams in
      their morbidity and mortality reviews and related scoring of the survivability of the
      patient’s cumulative injuries. This is an important collaboration between forensic pathology
      and clinical medicine. A review on various patterns and causes of hepatic necrosis, with
      excellent gross and microscopic photos, by Dr. Daniel Butler and coauthors Dr. David Lewin and
      Dr. Nicholas Batalis rounds out the coverage of the liver.</p><p>Finally, Laura Labay PhD, of NMS Laboratories, reviews the usefulness of bile in toxicology
      analysis. Bile is not a routinely tested matrix, and this article is useful in pointing out
      the occasions that bile may come in handy in the realm of forensic toxicology.</p><p>Having a journal with content that is of high quality, relevant, and timely, specific to
      forensic pathology, is extremely valuable to our specialty. Each issue is crafted by the
      efforts of our colleagues, and any coordinated endeavor of this scale takes much time and
      effort from all involved. My sincere thanks go to the authors in this issue, who kindly agreed
      to take time away from work, family, and other valued activities to create the invited, themed
      content in this issue for the edification of their colleagues near and far. For me personally,
      this has been a richly rewarding intellectual endeavor, and a fantastic opportunity to work
      more closely with colleagues well-known to me, as well as some I have gotten to know better
      through this process.</p><p>May your autopsy suites be well-lit, appropriately supplied, and very adequately staffed.</p></body></article>
