Occasionally we like to feature related disciplines that work closely with forensic pathology. Our goal was to assemble a collection of articles covering the aspects of forensic anthropology that are most important and applicable to forensic pathology practice, all in one place, with updates on the latest philosophies regarding anthropology practice, such as establishing the biological profile.</p><p>We begin with a discussion of accreditation for forensic anthropology laboratories, followed by an introductory paper on the utility of forensic anthropology within medical examiner/coroner offices. Much of forensic anthropology centers on identification, and we feature papers on the biological profile, metric and nonmetric methods of identification, and on the identification efforts of two large offices. We continue with papers on forensic anthropologists' use of NamUs and their work in identifying decedents in the American Southwest. Other topics include taphonomy, the use of forensic anthropology in mass fatality incidents, and three papers dealing with the anthropological assessment of trauma. Finally, we have a paper discussing the use of advanced imaging modalities as an adjunct to forensic anthropology. We also feature several original articles on various topics in forensic pathology.</p><p>The final issue of 2016 will be released on December 1; the theme will be “Child Abuse” and the Special Guest Editor will be Dr. Kathryn Pinneri. But remember, only about half of each issue is devoted to the specific theme. It's really just a way to promote submission of articles on a particular topic. Manuscripts about any topic can (and should) be submitted at any time! As always, I will continue to encourage the readership to submit articles to the Journal. We depend on submissions from the readership—NAME members like you—to sustain our excellent content.</p></body></article>
